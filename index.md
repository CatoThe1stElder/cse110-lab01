#### Preface
First and foremost, I hope all is well. My name is **Edmund Leibert** and I am currently an undergraduate passionate about the field of [geo-economics](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/geoeconomics-center/) data science. Alongside pursuing my degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering, I am compelled by the stunning quantitative research evolving in this realm and hope that my active reading in international relations gives me the opportunity. Why this field one may ask? Well, as someone who is versed in historical international politics, I am *confident* to say that the years of large scale outright military conflict between major powers are over. Instead, as we progress further into the 21st century, we will continue to see nations (as we already have) wield economic policy to...

rival states. With the explosion of data and the rapidly increasing complexity of this world, a new modern [quantitative skill set](# My-Skillset) is needed.

#### My Skillset
Having practiced over the years my skills in `R` and `Python` and `NoSql`, I am confident that my abilities can meet the needs of an entry position in this field. For instance, with my research under UC San Diego's linguistics [Professor Navida](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/), I honed my skills in compiling and analyzing large data sets of phonological stems. Furthermore, with being a student of the Early Research Scholar Program, I gained the vital critical thinking skills and familiarity of drafting a research proposal and understanding the methodologies of research. 

Trivia-wise, by favorite programming languages are...
1. C#
2. C++
3. Javascript
4. NoSQL

Also! To those lovers of Powershell, I cannot recommend enough installing Powerline. In short, Powerline provides a customized command prompt experience providing Git status color-coding and prompts. You can view it in all its glory [here](screenshots/terminal-img-2.png)! To work, just make sure you have installed...
